## Description

A self-directed experiment in exploring Leaflet using vanilla JS.

The web page provides a short step-by-step tutorial for developers to get started with Leaflet in order to build interactive map features that can be integrated with other data. Learn how to initialize a map, create a marker with a pop-up, add a layers control, and include a geocoder to search for different cities.

Tutorial includes from top to bottom

1. a map to facillitate instruction and learning,
2. background information to clarify the project's raison d'Ãªtre,
3. a site menu to navigate the tutorial and for learners to jump between the map and each section,
4. clear, step-by-step instructions in each section with code examples and supplementary details,
5. and finally, resources for learning Leaflet and React Leaflet.

**_Learning objective:_** To teach myself and other developers how to get started with Leaflet JS to create interactive maps. In addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases skill both in reading unfamiliar documentation and in communicating technical knowledge through clear writing supported by a well-designed pedagogical interface.
