        <section>
          <h3>What Is Leaflet?</h3>
          <p>
            According to its home page,
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/"
              title="To Leaflet's home page"
              target="_blank"
              >Leaflet</a
            >
            was created "11 years ago by Volodymyr Agafonkin, a Ukrainian
            citizen" and is "the leading open-source JavaScript library for
            mobile-friendly interactive maps."
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>The Purpose of This Tutorial:</h3>
          <p>
            This web page provides a short step-by-step tutorial for developers
            to get started with Leaflet in order to build interactive map
            features that can be integrated with other data. Learn how to
            initialize a map, create a marker with a pop-up, add a layers
            control, and include a geocoder to search for different cities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each instruction is assigned a number for quick identification,
            while each bullet point provides explanatory details as a supplement
            to clear up any possible confusion. It looks like a lot of text, but
            the process is actually quite simple. Run through these steps just
            once and a new world will open up for you to explore!
          </p>
          <p>
            Check out the resources after the tutorial to continue on this
            journey. Although the focus here is on Leaflet in vanilla
            JavaScript, there are additional resources at the bottom for
            developers who are interested in learning React Leaflet. Familiarity
            with the simple steps outlined below will make it a lot easier to
            delve into the documentation to experiment with building more
            complex map features.

          <h3>Personal Motivations:</h3>
          <p>
            Once I learned how to use Leaflet as an experimental design feature
            for my React weather application, I wanted to spread that knowledge
            to my development community at
            <a
              href="https://www.shecodes.io/students"
              target="_blank"
              title="To SheCodes Alumnae page"
              >SheCodes</a
            >. I also felt deeply moved by the inspiring examples on the pop-up
            on Leaflet's home page, which attest to the powerful storytelling
            that can be done with code and maps. I'm sharing this tutorial as a
            small tribute to the Ukrainian people by supporting Ukranian web
            development. I hope that you will feel inspired to take this
            knowledge further and create some cool apps! Happy coding!

          <li>
            Import Leaflet's <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> to the head of your index.html
            file by copying and pasting the link and script tags from the
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/download.html"
              title="To Leaflet's official documentation"
              target="_blank"
              >documentation</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an empty div and assign it an ID to target the map (use a
            descriptive name, such as <em>id</em> = "map" or <em>id</em> =
            "leaflet-map").
          </li>
          <li>
            Inside a style tag in the head, assign width and height to the map
            using the ID's selector. It is a requirement to assign a height to
            the map for Leaflet to work. (<strong>Tip:</strong> a rule set of
            {width: 100%; height: 100<abbr title="viewport height">vh</abbr>;}
            will render a full-screen map).
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To select an ID in
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, prepend the name
              of the ID with a pound sign (for an ID of "map", write #map).
            </li>
            <li>
              For more involved styling, consider linking to a separate
              stylesheet in the head tag of your
              <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file.
            </li>
            <li>
              For more information on how to style the map for mobile devices,

              Consider using a separate <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file
              for more involved projects. (Simply add an <em>src</em> attribute
              to the script tag and include the name of the file where you will
              write your <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, such as index.js,
              there.)
            </li>
            <li>
              (Alternatively, if using a separate
              <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file, for the script file to
              load more quickly, you could include the script tag with the
              <em>src</em> attribute in the head and include the
              <a

          <li>
            Inside the script tag (or your
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file), declare a map variable and
            use the syntax from Leaflet's

          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Here is the sample given: <br />
              <span class="code"
                >var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);</span

            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On the left side of the assignment operator, the variable named
                <em>map</em> is declared. (<strong
                  >Note to new developers:</strong
                >
                <em>var</em> is the

                >
                convention for declaring variables. Substitution of
                <em>var</em> by either of the now-common keywords
                <em>let</em> or <em>const</em> is acceptable here.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the right side of the assignment operator, the
                <em>L</em> signifies "Leaflet."
              </li>
              <li>
                After the dot operator and the method called <em>map</em>,
                include the map's ID from step 2 as the argument in parentheses.
                Wrap the ID in quotation marks.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the next dot operator, the purpose of the
                <em>setView</em> method is to determine the default coordinates
                and zoom level for the map. The method takes in its parentheses
                the coordinates [latitude, longitude] as the first argument and
                an integer designating the zoom level as a second argument. The
                first and second arguments are separated by a comma.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>A note about the zoom level:</strong> decrement the
                  integer to zoom out; increment the integer to zoom in. (To

              <li>
                The tile layer includes a URL and an attribution, so that credit

                  <strong>Note:</strong> Copy the attribution's code directly
                  from the documentation, not from the sample given here. The
                  browser's user agent rendered the symbol for copyright and the
                  anchor link wrapping "OpenStreetMap," interpreting the code
                  instead of faithfully transcribing it character by character.

          <li>
            For improved legibility, call the addTo(map) method on this new
            variable instead of at the end of the line above. For example:
            <span class="code">openStreetMap.addTo(map);</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Congratulations! You have initialized a map! Check the browser--by
            now, the OpenStreetMap tile layer should be visible as a map. If the
            image is broken, review steps 1 through 6 and use the information in
            the bullet points after each step to debug your application.

            of Leaflet's documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy this line of code from the "Usage example":
            <br />
            <span class="code">L.marker([50.5, 30.5]).addTo(map);</span>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explanation of the code above: This line instructs Leaflet (that
              is, <em>L</em>) to generate a marker at the coordinates specified.
              The in-built <em>marker</em> method takes as its first argument a
              latitude and a longitude separated by a comma and wrapped in
              square brackets. Notice that the latitude and longitude are NOT
              separate arguments. The <em>addTo(map)</em> method adds the marker
              to the map at the location designated by the given coordinates.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Paste that line into your <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> code
            anywhere beneath where you initialized the map with its first tile
            layer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modify the latitude and longitude in square brackets to reflect the
            coordinates of the location where you wish to place the marker.
          </li>
          <li>
            To keep track of any icon that you create in this way, declare a
            variable and assign it to the line of code that generates the
            marker. Then you can remove the <em>addTo(map)</em> method from the
            end and instead call that method on the variable. For example:
            <br />
            <span class="code"
              >const defaultMarker = L.marker([50.4501, 33.5234]);</span
            >
            <br />
            <span class="code">defaultMarker.addTo(map);</span>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Assigning the marker to a variable will make the logic of your
              code more intelligible when you want to add a pop-up.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <h4>To add a pop-up on this default marker:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Visit the
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#popup"
              target="_blank"
              title="To the Popup section of Leaflet's documentation"
              >Popup section</a
            >
            of Leaflet's documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the "Usage example," copy this line of code: <br />
            <span class="code"
              >marker.bindPopup(popupContent).openPopup();</span
            >
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explanation of the code above: The <em>bindPopup</em> method is
              called on the marker in order to bind the pop-up's message to the
              marker. A placeholder for the pop-up content is given in
              parentheses as the <em>bindPopup</em> method's argument. Then, the
              <em>openPopup</em> method is called on the pop-up that is bound to
              the marker; its purpose is to enable the opening of the pop-up
              message on the marker.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                As it says in the documentation, "Use

                >
                to open popups while making sure that only one popup is open at
                one time (recommended for usability), or use

                to open as many as you want".
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Declare a variable for the pop-up and paste the code that you copied
            to the right of assignment operator. Substitute your marker's
            variable (from step 6 of "To create a default marker" in this
            tutorial) for
            <em>marker</em>. Substitute your message for the placeholder
            <em>popupContent</em>. Wrap your message in quotation marks within
            the parentheses to make it a string. For example:
            <br />
            <span class="code"
              >const defaultMarkerPopup = defaultMarker.bindPopup("I am the
              default marker's popup!").openPopup();</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, with your code formatted in this manner, you can eliminate
            the
            <em>addTo(map)</em> method called on the default marker in step 6 of
            "To create a default marker" in this tutorial. Instead, you can add
            the default marker and the pop-up together in one line of code to
            the map. So, on the next line of your coding editor, call the
            <em>addTo(map)</em> method on the variable you declared for storing
            the pop-up. For example:
            <br />
            <span class="code">defaultMarkerPopup.addTo(map);</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Now there should be a default marker on the map at the coordinates
            you specified with your pop-up message when you click on the marker!
            Check your map and return to these steps if you need to troubleshoot
            any problems.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For a customized marker:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Explore the map at the top of this web page. Slightly off-center,
            there is a red icon of a thermometer. That is a marker with a
            customized icon. Click on the thermometer icon to see the pop-up
            message!
          </li>
          <li>
            Before we create the new marker, let's store the information for our
            customized icon in a new variable. Here is an example of how to
            generate a customized icon in Leaflet:
            <br />
            <span class="code"
              >const customIcon = L.icon({iconUrl:
              "./images/thermometer-icon-marker.png", iconSize: [45, 45],
              });</span
            >
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explanation of the code above: The keyword <em>const</em> declares
              a constant variable named <em>customIcon</em>. After the
              assignment operator, Leaflet (that is, <em>L</em>) is instructed
              to generate an icon by using the <em>icon</em> method. In
              parentheses, the argument of the <em>icon</em> method is an object
              in curly braces. The object has two properties:
              <em>iconUrl</em> and <em>iconSize</em>, separated by a comma. The
              value of the property <em>iconUrl</em> is the path to the image
              file to be used as the customized icon. It is wrapped in quotation
              marks. The value of the property <em>iconSize</em> is an array
              with two integer values separated by a comma. The first integer
              value represents the width in pixels of the icon, while the second
              integer value represents its height in pixels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Note:</strong> The value of the property
              <em>iconUrl</em> can be either the path to the image file or the
              URL at which that image is hosted.
            </li>
            <li>
              To see other optional properties you could use to further
              customize the icon's appearance, go to Leaflet's documentation on
              <a
                href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/"
                target="_blank"
                title="To Leaflet's documentation: Markers with Custom Icons"
                >Markers with Custom Icons</a
              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Now let's create a new marker that will use the customized icon.
            Declare a new variable to store the new marker. As with the default
            marker, you will have to specify the coordinates at which you would
            like the marker to appear. After the coordinates, include the icon
            option as a second parameter, like this:
            <br />
            <span class="code"
              >const customMarker = L.marker([50.4501, 30.5234], { icon:
              customIcon, });</span
            >
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explanation of the code above: The keyword <em>const</em> declares
              a new constant variable named <em>customMarker</em>. After the
              assignment operator, Leaflet (that is, <em>L</em>) is instructed
              to generate a marker. In this case, the <em>marker</em> method
              takes two arguments separated by a comma, with the two arguments
              wrapped in parentheses. The first argument is the latitude and
              longitude separated by a comma and wrapped in square brackets. The
              second argument uses curly braces and includes the icon option.
              The value of the property <em>icon</em> is the variable
              <em>customIcon</em> that we created in the previous step.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            To add the new marker with the customized icon to the map, call the
            <em>addTo(map)</em> method on the variable you created in the
            previous step. For example,
            <br />
            <span class="code">customMarker.addTo(map);</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To add a pop-up on this customized marker:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            This process is essentially the same as the process to add a pop-up
            on the default marker. The only difference is that the customized
            icon needed to be generated and included in a new marker before
            binding the pop-up to it. Below is an example of a pop-up on the
            customized marker that we created above:
            <br />
            <span class="code"
              >const customMarkerPopup = customMarker.bindPopup("I am a pop-up
              on the customized marker!").openPopup();</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, when we add <em>customMarkerPopup</em> to the map using the
            <em>addTo(map)</em> method, we can refactor our code. Eliminate the
            line of code added in step 4 of "For a customized marker." When you
            add the following code, it will add the pop-up with the marker
            simultaneously to the map:
            <br />
            <span class="code">customMarkerPopup.addTo(map);</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To customize the pop-up display using CSS:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is possible to change how the pop-up looks. Because markers are
            important for displaying data at particular locations, it is worth
            experimenting with DevTools in the browser to customize how data are
            being displayed. (By "DevTools," I mean the developer tools that are
            available when you "right-click" on a web page and select the
            "Inspect" option from the drop-down list.) By using DevTools to
            target elements on the map that reveal Leaflet's CSS classes, you
            can easily override Leaflet's default styling and reassign
            properties to customize elements like pop-ups. For instance, in the
            map at the top of this web page, the default styling of the pop-ups,
            which had a white background and black text, has been changed to a
            black background with the text in white. Far more elaborate changes
            are possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are welcome to experiment with my map, hack the current CSS
            using DevTools, and discover which of Leaflet's classes are
            controlling the default appearance of elements. That's how I
            learned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have identified which classes control what, you can target
            those classes from your CSS outside of the browser in your text
            editor to make the changes persist. Otherwise, the changes that you
            make in DevTools alone will disappear upon refreshing the page. Good
            luck, and have fun!

        <h4>To add new tile layers:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Browse Leaflet's tile layer providers

              >here</a
            >.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You will see a documentation window affixed to the top-center and
              a scrollable sidebar to the right.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Simply select the tile layer you would like to add to your map, look
            in the documentation window for the section “Plain JavaScript,” and
            copy the code you see there. It will resemble the code used to add
            the OpenStreetMap tile layer in step 6 of "How to Initialize the
            Map" in this tutorial.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you select an option from the sidebar, the map that forms the
              web page's main background will change to provide a preview of the
              tile layer selected.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the preview is not visible, it is possible that that option is
              restricted to a particular range of zoom levels. Try zooming in or
              out using your mouse or trackpad to see if the preview activates.
              Otherwise, you might need an API key to view or use the tile
              layer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Once you paste that code from the documentation into the
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> portion of your code, use the dot
            operator and call the <em>addTo(map)</em> method on the variable
            storing the tile layer, just as you did in step 8 of "How to
            Initialize the Map" in this tutorial.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Although the tile layers on that page are
              free, some of them require an API key. Take a closer look at the
              tile layer's URL or the extra, parameterized options in curly
              braces sometimes provided after the URL for an indication that an
              API key is needed.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can find out more information, such as which tile layer
                  providers require registration, if you click

            Navigate to the Layers Control section of Leaflet’s documentation by

            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since you have already initialized your map and added the base
            layers, you can scroll past the first block of example code and go
            directly to this example:<br /><span class="code"
              >var baseMaps = {"OpenStreetMap": osm, "Mapbox Streets":
              streets};<br />var overlayMaps = {"Cities": cities};</span
            >
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explanation of the first code block above: The keyword
              <em>var</em> declares the variable <em>baseMaps</em>. The variable
              is assigned to an object. The object's properties are strings that
              are named after the tile layers included as base layers
              ("OpenStreetMap" and "Mapbox Streets"). The value of each property
              is the variable under which that tile layer is stored (in the
              example code, <em>osm</em> is the variable storing the tile layer
              for "OpenStreetMap").
              <ul>
                <li>
                  However the property is named is how it will appear named in
                  the tile layer controller on the map.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The order in which each property is declared in the object
                  will determine the order in which each tile layer appears in
                  the controller.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Explanation of the second code block above: The keyword
              <em>var</em> declares the variable <em>overlayMaps</em>. The
              variable is assigned to an object. The property "Cities" is a
              string; its value is the variable <em>cities</em>. The string
              "Cities" will appear in the tile layer controller on the map. The
              user will be able to check or uncheck a box next to "Cities" in
              order to use <var>cities</var> as an overlay to the map or to
              remove <var>cities</var> from the display.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To visualize this feature better, imagine that instead of
                "Cities" the property were "Marker" and that the variable stored
                a particular marker icon on the map. Without affecting the base
                layer map, the user could easily activate or deactivate that
                marker by checking the box next to "Marker" in the tile layer
                controller.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Once you understand the example code above, use the first code block
            as the template to organize your layers. Declare a variable for your
            base layers. Assign that variable to an object. In between curly
            braces, assign properties that are strings and that correspond to
            the name of each tile layer that you have already added to the map.
            Follow each property's name with a colon. After the colon, assign a
            value. The value should be the variable that stores each
            corresponding tile layer (that is, the variable created in step 7
            under "How to Initialize the Map" in this tutorial). Be sure to
            include a comma after the value when listing multiple properties in
            the object.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have an markers or other overlays that you would like to
            organize in the layers control, use the second code block as the
            template. Declare a variable for your base layers. Assign that
            variable to an object. In between curly braces, assign properties
            that are strings and that correspond to the name of each marker or
            overlay that you have already added to the map. Follow each
            property's name with a colon. After the colon, assign a value. The
            value should be the variable that stores each corresponding marker
            or overlay. Be sure to include a comma after the value when listing
            multiple properties in the object.
          </li>
          <li>
            Head back to the
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/"
              target="_blank"
              title="To Leaflet's documentation on Layer Groups and Layers Control"
              >Layers Control page</a
            >
            of Leaflet's documentation. Scroll down to this line of code:
            <br />
            <span class="code"
              >var layerControl = L.control.layers(baseMaps,
              overlayMaps).addTo(map);</span
            >
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explanation of the code above: The variable
              <em>layerControl</em> is declared. To the right of the assignment
              operator, the in-built <em>control</em> method tells Leaflet (that
              is, <em>L</em>) to add the layers provided in parentheses to the
              map. The first argument of the <em>layers</em> method is
              <em>baseMaps</em>, and it takes the base layers' object. The
              second argument of the <em>layers</em> method is
              <em>overlayMaps</em>, and it takes the overlays' object.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Underneath the base layers' object and the overlays' object that you
            created in steps 4 and 5 above, paste the code that creates and adds
            the layers control to the map. You can eliminate the declaration of
            the variable and the assignment operator. Include everything to the
            right of the equal sign. Modify the
            <em>layers</em> method's parameters so that the names reflect the
            names you assigned to your base layers' object and/or your overlays'
            object.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you want to include only the base layers' object, you do not
              have to include the second argument.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to include only the overlays' object, pass
              <em>null</em> as the first argument and include the overlays'
              object as the second argument.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Great! Check the browser to see your layers control! Is the icon
            appearing in the top-right corner? When you hover the mouse over the
            icon, does the layers control open and display the list of base
            layers and overlays without errors? When you select each option in
            turn, does the display change? If something went wrong, review the
            steps and information above.

          How to Include a Geocoder Plug-in to Search for Cities on the Map:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To start, glance at the map at the top of this web page. Look for
            the small icon of a magnifying glass in the top-right corner. When
            you click on the icon, a search bar will unfold. Type in the name of
            a city and press Enter. A drop-down menu of valid locations will
            appear. When you select a location from the list, the map's view
            will change to that location, and you will see a marker with an open
            pop-up that reads the location's name! That is the feature that the
            geocoder plug-in enables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now that you know what we're building, go to the GitHub repository
            for the
            <a
              href="https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-control-geocoder"
              target="_blank"
              title="To GitHub repository for Leaflet Control Geocoder plug-in"
              >Leaflet Control Geocoder plug-in</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scroll down to the documentation underneath the repository. Go to
            the "Usage" section and copy both the link and script tags you see
            there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paste that code into the head of your index.html file. You have now
            imported the geocoder plug-in's
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> to your project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assuming that you have already initialized your map and added a tile
            layer (such as OpenStreetMap) to the map, you can now add the
            geocoder to the map. Simply add this line of code to your
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> code underneath where you
            initialized the map and added the tile layer(s): <br /><span
              class="code"
              >L.Control.geocoder().addTo(map);</span
            >
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              By now, the <em>addTo(map)</em> method should be familiar. To read
              about the <em>L.Control</em> method for adding map controls, go to
              <a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control"
                >this section</a
              >
              of Leaflet's documentation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            That's it! Take a look at your map in the browser to verify that the
            icon of the magnifying glass is there and that the search engine is
            working.
