      <h1>Leaflet Tutorial</h1>
        <h3>Background Information:</h3>
          <p>According to its home page, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="To Leaflet's home page" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> was created "11 years ago by Volodymyr Agafonkin, a Ukrainian citizen" and is "the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps." This web page provides a short step-by-step tutorial for developers to get started with Leaflet in order to build interactive map features that can be integrated with other data. Although the focus here is on Leaflet in vanilla JavaScript, there are resources at the bottom for developers who are interested in learning React Leaflet.
          </p>
          <p>Familiarity with the basics helped me immensely when I was figuring out how to integrate my React weather application with React Leaflet! Once I learned how to use Leaflet, I wanted to spread that knowledge to my development community at <a href=https://www.shecodes.io/students" target="_blank" title="To SheCodes Alumnae page">SheCodes</a>. I also felt deeply moved by the inspiring examples on the pop-up on Leaflet's home page, which attest to the powerful storytelling that can be done with code and maps. I'm sharing this tutorial as a small tribute to the Ukrainian people by supporting Ukranian web development.</p>
      <h3>Steps to Display a Map:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Import Leaflet's <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> to your index.html file by copying and pasting the link and script
          tags from the
          <a
          href="https://leafletjs.com/download.html"
          title="To Leaflet's official documentation"
          target="_blank"
          >documentation</a
          >.
        <li>Create a div and assign it an ID to target the map. (Use a descriptive name, such as "map" or "leaflet-map.")</li>
        <li>
          Inside a style tag in the head, assign width and height to the map using the ID's selector. It is a requirement to assign a height to the map for Leaflet to work.  (<strong>Tip:</strong> a rule set of {width:
          100%; height: 100<abbr title="viewport height">vh</abbr>;} will render a full-screen map).
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To select an ID in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, prepend the name of the ID with a pound sign (for an ID of "map", write #map).
            </li>
            <li>
              For more involved styling, consider linking to a separate stylesheet in the head tag of your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file.
            </li>
            <li>
              For more information on how to style the map for mobile devices, see <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/mobile/" title="To Leaflet on Mobile Tutorial" target="_blank">Leaflet on Mobile</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Add a script tag above the body's closing tag.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
Consider using a separate <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file for more involved projects. (Simply add an <em>src</em> attribute to the script tag and include the name of the file where you will write your <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, such as index.js, there.)
<li>(Alternatively, if using a separate <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file, for the script file to load more quickly, you could include the script tag with the <em>src</em> attribute in the head and include the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async" title="To MDN async attribute documentation" target="_blank"><em>async</em> attribute</a>.)</li>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Inside the script tag (or your <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file), declare a map variable and use the syntax from Leaflet's <a href="https://leafletjs.com/index.html" title="To Leaflet's overview" target="_blank">overview</a>. Explanation of the syntax below:</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Here is the sample given: <br />
            <span class="code">var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);</span></li>
            <ul>
              <li>On the left side of the equal sign, the variable named "map" is declared. (<strong>Note to new developers:</strong> "var" is the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/javascript-versions" target="_blank" title="Learn about JavaScript Versions: ES6 and Before on Codecademy">pre-<abbr title="ECMAScript 6">ES6</abbr></a> convention for declaring variables. Substitution of "var" by either of the now-common keywords "let" or "const" is fine here.</li>
              <li>The "L" signifies "Leaflet."</li>
              <li>After the dot operator and the function "map," include the map's ID from step 2 as the argument. Wrap the ID in quotation marks.</li>
              <li>The purpose of the setView method is to determine the default coordinates and zoom level for the map. The method takes the coordinates [latitude, longitude] as the first argument and an integer designating the zoom level as a second argument.</li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>A note about the zoom level:</strong> decrement the integer to zoom out; increment the integer to zoom in.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Include the next line of code from Leaflet's <a href="https://leafletjs.com/index.html" title="To Leaflet's overview" target="_blank">overview</a> to add the tile layer to the map.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The tile layer includes a URL and an attribution, so that credit is given where credit is due.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the map at the top of this web page, each of the map display options in the top-right corner (excluding the markers) represents a different tile layer. The attribution appears with a link to Leaflet at the bottom or bottom-right corner of the map.
                </li>
                <li>To learn more about tile layers, check out <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/adding-tile-layers-to-your-web-map/#:~:text=A%20tile%20layer%20is%20a,format%20on%20the%20web%20server." target="_blank" title="Adding Tile Layers to Your Web Map | ArcGIS Blog">this blog post</a>.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Here is the sample given:
              <br />
              <span class="code">L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {attribution: '&copy;  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'}).addTo(map);</span>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Note:</strong> Copy the attribution's code directly from the documentation, not from the sample given here. The browser's user agent rendered the symbol for copyright and the anchor link wrapping "OpenStreetMap," interpreting the code instead of faithfully transcribing it character by character.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assign this code to a variable (for example, <span class="code">const openStreetMap = L.tileLayer</span> etc.)</li>
            <li>Call the addTo(map) method on this new variable (for example, <span class="code">openStreetMap.addTo(map);</span> for improved legibility).</li>
          </ul>
