          <h3>What Is Leaflet?</h3>
          <p>
            According to its home page,
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/"
              title="To Leaflet's home page"
              target="_blank"
              >Leaflet</a
            >
            was created "11 years ago by Volodymyr Agafonkin, a Ukrainian
            citizen" and is "the leading open-source JavaScript library for
            mobile-friendly interactive maps."
          </p>

          <h3>The Purpose of This Tutorial:</h3>
          <p>
            This web page provides a short step-by-step tutorial for developers
            to get started with Leaflet in order to build interactive map
            features that can be integrated with other data. Learn how to
            initialize a map, create a marker with a pop-up, add a layers
            control, and include a geocoder to search for different cities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each instruction is assigned a number for quick identification,
            while each bullet point provides explanatory details as a supplement
            to clear up any possible confusion. It looks like a lot of text, but
            the process is actually quite simple. Run through these steps just
            once and a new world will open up for you to explore!
          </p>
          <p>
            Check out the resources after the tutorial to continue on this
            journey. Although the focus here is on Leaflet in vanilla
            JavaScript, there are additional resources at the bottom for
            developers who are interested in learning React Leaflet. Familiarity
            with the simple steps outlined below will make it a lot easier to
            delve into the documentation to experiment with building more
            complex map features.

          <h3>Personal Motivations:</h3>
          <p>
            Once I learned how to use Leaflet as an experimental design feature
            for my React weather application, I wanted to spread that knowledge
            to my development community at
            <a
              href="https://www.shecodes.io/students"
              target="_blank"
              title="To SheCodes Alumnae page"
              >SheCodes</a
            >. I also felt deeply moved by the inspiring examples on the pop-up
            on Leaflet's home page, which attest to the powerful storytelling
            that can be done with code and maps. I'm sharing this tutorial as a
            small tribute to the Ukrainian people by supporting Ukranian web
            development. I hope that you will feel inspired to take this
            knowledge further and create some cool apps! Happy coding!

        <ol>
          <li>
            Import Leaflet's <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> to your index.html file by
            copying and pasting the link and script tags from the
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/download.html"

              target="_blank"
              >documentation</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an empty div and assign it an ID to target the map. (Use a
            descriptive name, such as "map" or "leaflet-map.")
          </li>
          <li>
            Inside a style tag in the head, assign width and height to the map
            using the ID's selector. It is a requirement to assign a height to
            the map for Leaflet to work. (<strong>Tip:</strong> a rule set of
            {width: 100%; height: 100<abbr title="viewport height">vh</abbr>;}
            will render a full-screen map).
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To select an ID in
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, prepend the name
              of the ID with a pound sign (for an ID of "map", write #map).
            </li>
            <li>
              For more involved styling, consider linking to a separate
              stylesheet in the head tag of your
              <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file.
            </li>
            <li>
              For more information on how to style the map for mobile devices,
              see

          <li>Add a script tag above the body's closing tag.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Consider using a separate <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file
              for more involved projects. (Simply add an <em>src</em> attribute
              to the script tag and include the name of the file where you will
              write your <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, such as index.js,
              there.)
            </li>
            <li>
              (Alternatively, if using a separate
              <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file, for the script file to
              load more quickly, you could include the script tag with the
              <em>src</em> attribute in the head and include the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async"

            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Inside the script tag (or your
            <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> file), declare a map variable and
            use the syntax from Leaflet's
            <a
              href="https://leafletjs.com/index.html"
              title="To Leaflet's overview"

              >overview</a

          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Here is the sample given: <br />
              <span class="code"
                >var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);</span
              >
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On the left side of the assignment operator, the variable named
                <em>map</em> is declared. (<strong
                  >Note to new developers:</strong
                >
                <em>var</em> is the
                <a
                  href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/javascript-versions"
                  target="_blank"

                  >pre-<abbr title="ECMAScript 6">ES6</abbr></a
                >
                convention for declaring variables. Substitution of
                <em>var</em> by either of the now-common keywords
                <em>let</em> or <em>const</em> is acceptable here.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the right side of the assignment operator, the
                <em>L</em> signifies "Leaflet."
              </li>
              <li>
                After the dot operator and the method called <em>map</em>,
                include the map's ID from step 2 as the argument in parentheses.
                Wrap the ID in quotation marks.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the next dot operator, the purpose of the
                <em>setView</em> method is to determine the default coordinates
                and zoom level for the map. The method takes in its parentheses
                the coordinates [latitude, longitude] as the first argument and
                an integer designating the zoom level as a second argument. The
                first and second arguments are separated by a comma.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>A note about the zoom level:</strong> decrement the
                  integer to zoom out; increment the integer to zoom in. (To

              <li>
                The tile layer includes a URL and an attribution, so that credit

                  display options in the top-right corner (excluding the
                  markers) represents a different tile layer. The attribution
                  appears with a link to Leaflet at the bottom or bottom-right

                  <strong>Note:</strong> Copy the attribution's code directly
                  from the documentation, not from the sample given here. The
                  browser's user agent rendered the symbol for copyright and the
                  anchor link wrapping "OpenStreetMap," interpreting the code
                  instead of faithfully transcribing it character by character.

              </ul>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Assign this code to a variable (for example,
            <span class="code">const openStreetMap = L.tileLayer</span> etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Call the addTo(map) method on this new variable instead of at the
            end of the line above (for example,
            <span class="code">openStreetMap.addTo(map);</span> for improved
            legibility).
          </li>
          <li>
            Congratulations! You have initialized a map! Check the browser--by
            now, the OpenStreetMap tile layer should be visible as a map. If the
            image is broken, review steps 1 through 6 and use the information in
            the bullet points after each step to debug your application.

            <li>
              Simply select the tile layer you would like to add to your map,
              look in the documentation window for the section “Plain
              JavaScript,” and copy the code you see there. It will resemble the
              code used to add the OpenStreetMap tile layer in step 6 of "How to
              Initialize the Map" in this tutorial.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When you select an option from the sidebar, the map that forms
                the web page's main background will change to provide a preview
                of the tile layer selected.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the preview is not visible, it is possible that that option
                is restricted to a particular range of zoom levels. Try zooming
                in or out using your mouse or trackpad to see if the preview
                activates. Otherwise, you might need an API key to view or use
                the tile layer.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Once you paste that code from the documentation into the
              <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> portion of your code, use the
              dot operator and call the <em>addTo(map)</em> method on the
              variable storing the tile layer, just as you did in step 6 of "How
              to Initialize the Map" in this tutorial.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Although the tile layers on that page are
                free, some of them require an API key. Take a closer look at the
                tile layer's URL or the extra, parameterized options sometimes
                provided after the URL for an indication that an API key is
                needed.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You can find out more information, such as which tile layer
                    providers require registration, if you click
                    <a

                    >
                    and scroll down or click the link at the top of the tile
                    layer providers page that reads "Leaflet-providers" to get
                    to the same web page.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <strong
              >To keep multiple tile layers organized and separable in the

            >
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Take a quick look at the example map at the top of this web page.
              The layers control is represented by the large icon in the
              top-right corner. Hover the cursor over that icon. When you do so,
              the layers control will open and you will be able to select a tile
              layer by name to display.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The options with circles which are listed above the line in
                  the layers control represent the base layers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The options with squares which are listed below the line
                  represent overlays, such as markers.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigate to the Layers Control section of Leaflet’s documentation
              by clicking
              <a
                href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/"
                title="To Leaflet's documentation on Layer Groups and Layers Control"
                target="_blank"
                >this link</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since you have already initialized your map and added the base
              layers, you can scroll past the first block of example code and go
              directly to this example:<br /><span class="code"
                >var baseMaps = {"OpenStreetMap": osm, "Mapbox Streets":
                streets};<br />var overlayMaps = {"Cities": cities};</span
              >
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Explanation of the first code block above: The keyword
                  <em>var</em> declares the variable <em>baseMaps</em>. The
                  variable is assigned to an object. The object's properties are
                  strings that are named after the tile layers included as base
                  layers ("OpenStreetMap" and "Mapbox Streets"). The value of
                  each property is the variable under which that tile layer is
                  stored (in the example code, <em>osm</em> is the variable
                  storing the tile layer for "OpenStreetMap").
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      However the property is named is how it will appear named
                      in the tile layer controller on the map.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The order in which each property is declared in the object
                      will determine the order in which each tile layer appears
                      in the controller.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Explanation of the second code block above: The keyword
                  <em>var</em> declares the variable <em>overlayMaps</em>. The
                  variable is assigned to an object. The property "Cities" is a
                  string; its value is the variable <em>cities</em>. The string
                  "Cities" will appear in the tile layer controller on the map.
                  The user will be able to check or uncheck a box next to
                  "Cities" in order to use <var>cities</var> as an overlay to
                  the map or to remove <var>cities</var> from the display.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To visualize this feature better, imagine that instead of
                    "Cities" the property were "Marker" and that the variable
                    stored a particular marker icon on the map. Without
                    affecting the base layer map, the user could easily activate
                    or deactivate that marker by checking the box next to
                    "Marker" in the tile layer controller.
